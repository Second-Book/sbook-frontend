I created a project description along with my design vision.

Project description & functionality:  
SecondBook is a platform for buying and selling used textbooks at affordable prices. Users can contact sellers via the built-in site chat or through the provided external contact details.

User profiles:  
All residents of Belgrade.

1. For grades 1 to 8 – these are parents (30-45 years old) looking to save money on textbooks.  
Currently, such families usually visit textbook markets where they can buy almost any book at 50-60% of its original price.  
Some of them also sell books via https://www.kupujemprodajem.com/ (a Serbian equivalent of Avito/Russian marketplace).

2. For grades 9 to 12 – students (high school or college) who are already more advanced internet users.

My design suggestions:  
1. A minimalist style, but with some bold and cheerful elements, as many users will be children or teenagers.  
2. A clear and intuitive interface, so users can easily understand how to find or post textbooks right from the homepage.  
3. It’s important to make it clear that everything is free, including posting ads.

Pages and functionality:  

1. Homepage – displays the latest textbooks uploaded by users in a grid layout (4 in a row) with infinite scroll. A prominent search bar for keywords and an "Advanced Search" button with filters (grade, subject, publisher, condition, etc.).

2. Textbook details page – shows photos, description (condition, price, grade, etc.), and seller contact info. There's also a "Message Seller" button for chatting via the built-in messenger or accessing external contacts (phone, messengers).

3. Post an ad page – a simple and user-friendly form with fields: textbook title, photo, description, price, and contact info. It’s important to highlight that posting is free (e.g., a note below the "Post" button).

4. User dashboard – displays all active listings of the user, with options to edit or delete them. Incoming messages from other users will also be shown here.

5. Chat/Messages – a built-in messenger for communication between buyers and sellers. Clean and simple interface without unnecessary elements.

6. About / FAQ page – a dedicated page with a short description of the platform, basic rules, and answers to common questions (e.g., how to find a textbook, how to sell, etc.).

7. 404 / Error page – minimalist, but with a friendly illustration or visual accent to stay within a "welcoming and easy-to-use" theme.

8. Login page

9. Registration page

https://bookscouter.com/ (we like the idea, similar to ours; they aggregate data from other platforms — something we may also implement in the future)

You can also find more interesting websites by searching for  
"Share textbooks", "Buy used textbooks", and exploring additional platforms online.
